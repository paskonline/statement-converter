[![Live Demo](https://img.shields.io/badge/Live-Demo-brightgreen.svg)](https://azite01.github.io/statement-converter/)

A lightweight, purely client-side web tool designed to quickly convert Bank of Ceylon (BOC) credit card statement PDFs into clean, formatted CSV files. 

This tool eliminates the need for manual data entry, making it perfect for rapid month-end financial reconciliation and expense tracking. It cleans up the messy, unformatted text that happens when copying directly from a PDF and automatically organizes it into structured columns.

## 🔒 Privacy & Security

**Your financial data never leaves your device.** 

This tool is built entirely with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. There is no backend, no database, and no server-side processing. When you paste your statement text into the tool, all parsing and math are executed locally within your web browser's memory. Once you close the tab, the data is gone. 

## ✨ Features

* **Smart Parsing:** Automatically detects dates and transaction amounts, ignoring headers, footers, and messy PDF line breaks.
* **Auto-Calculated Balances:** Detects the "Opening Balance" and maintains a running calculation of your balance across all Debits and Credits.
* **Dr / Cr Separation:** Splits transactions into dedicated Debit and Credit columns for easy spreadsheet formulas.
* **Mobile Responsive:** Fully optimized for mobile devices with a swipeable data table and touch-friendly interface.
* **Instant Export:** Generates a ready-to-use `.csv` file with a single click.
